# Mental Models

Read this code:

读下面代码：
```js
let a = 10;
let b = a;
a = 0;
```

What are the values of a and b after it runs? Work it out in your head before reading further.

在进一步阅读之前，请思考这段代码运行之后，a,b的值是多少呢？

If you’ve been writing JavaScript for a while, you might object: “This snippet is much simpler than the code I’m writing every day. What’s the point?”

如果你已经使用JavaScript一段时间，你可能会反对: “这个代码片段比我每天编写的代码简单得多。 有什么意义呢? ”

The goal of this exercise isn’t to introduce you to variables. We assume you’re already familiar with them. Instead, it is to make you notice and reflect on your mental model.

这个练习的目的不是向你介绍变量。我们假设你已经非常熟悉他们。相反，它是让你注意到并反思你的思维模型。

## What’s a Mental Model?

Read the code above again with an intention to really be sure what the result is. (We’ll see why this intention is important a bit later.)

再次阅读上面的代码，以确定结果是什么。 (我们稍后会看到为什么这个意图是重要的。)

While you’re reading it for the second time, pay close attention to what’s happening in your head, step by step. You might notice a monologue like this:

当你再读第二遍的时候，请密切关注你脑子里正在发生的事情，一步一步来。 你可能会注意到这样的独白:

```js
let a = 10;
```

Declare a variable called a. Set it to 10.

声明一个a的变量，设置为10
```js
let b = a;
```
Declare a variable called b. Set it to a.

声明一个b的变量，设置为a

Wait, what’s a again? Ah, it was 10. So b is 10 too.

等等，为什么又是a? 啊，它是10。所以b也是10

a = 0;

Set the a variable to 0.

把a变量设置为0

So a is 0 now, and b is 10. That’s our answer.

所以a的值现在是0，b的值10。这是我们的答案。

Maybe your monologue is a bit different. Maybe you say “assign” instead of “set”, or maybe you read it in a slightly different order. Maybe you arrived at a different result. Pay attention to how exactly it was different. Note how even this monologue doesn’t capture what’s really happening in your head. You might say “set b to a”, but what does it even mean to set a variable?

可能你的独白有一点点的不同。可能你用“赋值”代替“设置”，或者你的阅读顺序略有不同。你也有不同的答案。请注意它为什么不同。即使这段独白不能体现你的脑海正在发生什么。你可能会说“a设置为b” ，但是设置一个变量意味着什么呢？

You might find that for every familiar fundamental programming concept (like a variable) and operations on it (like setting its value), there is a set of deep-rooted analogies that you associated with it.

您可能会发现，对于每一个熟悉的基本编程概念(比如变量)及其上的操作(比如设置其值) ，都有一组与之关联的根深蒂固的类比。

Some of them may come from the real world. Others may be repurposed from other fields you learned first, like numbers from math. These analogies might overlap and even contradict each other, but they still help you make sense of what’s happening in the code.

其中一些可能来自现实世界。 还有一些可能是从你最先学到的其他领域转变而来的，比如数学中的数字。 这些类比可能会重叠，甚至相互矛盾，但它们仍然可以帮助您理解代码中发生的事情。

For example, many people first learned about variables as “boxes” into which you can put stuff. Even if you don’t vividly imagine boxes anymore when you see a variable, they might still behave “boxy” in your imagination.

例如，许多人第一次了解到变量是“盒子” ，你可以把东西放进去。 即使当你看到一个变量时，你不再生动地想象盒子，它们在你的想象中仍可能表现为“盒状”。

These approximations of how something works in your head are known as “mental models”. It may be hard if you’ve been programming for a long time, but try to notice and introspect your mental models. They’re probably a combination of visual, spatial, and mechanical mental shortcuts.

这些在你头脑中运作的东西的近似值被称为“思维模型”。 如果你已经编程了很长一段时间，这可能会很难，但是试着注意和反省你的思维模式。 它们可能是视觉、空间和机械思维捷径的组合。

These intuitions (like “boxiness” of variables) influence how we read code our whole lives. But sometimes, our mental models are wrong. Maybe a tutorial we read early on has sacrificed correctness for the ease of explaining. Maybe we incorrectly transferred an intuition about a particular language feature, like this, from another language we learned earlier. Maybe we inferred a mental model from some piece of code and never really verified if it was accurate.

这些直觉（如变量的“灵活性”）影响我们一生阅读代码的方式。但是有时候，我们的思维模式是错误的。也许我们早期阅读的教程为了简化说明而牺牲了正确性。也许我们错误地从我们先前学习的另一种语言中转移了关于特定语言功能的直觉。也许我们是从一些代码中推断出一个心理模型，却从未真正验证过它是否准确。

Identifying and fixing these problems is what Just JavaScript is all about. We will gradually build (or, possibly, rebuild) your mental model of JavaScript to be accurate and useful. A good mental model will help you find and fix bugs faster, understand other people’s code better, and feel confident in the code you write.

识别和解决这些问题就是Just JavaScript的全部目的。我们将逐步构建（或可能重建）您的JavaScript思维模型，以使其更加准确和有用。良好的思维模式将帮助您更快地发现和修复错误，更好地理解他人的代码，并对自己编写的代码充满信心。

(By the way, a being 0 and b being 10 is the correct answer.)

(顺便说一句，a为0，b为10是正确的答案。)

## Coding, Fast and Slow

“Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman is a widely popular non-fiction book. Its central thesis is that humans use two different “systems” when thinking.
Whenever we can, we rely on the “fast” system. We share this system with many animals, and that gives us amazing powers like walking without falling all the time. This “fast” system is good at pattern matching (necessary for survival!) and “gut reactions”. But it’s not good at planning.

丹尼尔·卡尼曼（Daniel Kahneman）的《思考，快和慢》是一本广受欢迎的非小说类书籍。其中心论点是，人类在思考时会使用两种不同的“系统”。只要有可能，我们就依靠“快速”系统。我们与许多动物共享此系统，这给了我们惊人的力量，例如走路时始终不会跌倒。这种“快速”系统擅长模式匹配（生存所必需！）和“胆量反应”。但这并不擅长计划

Uniquely, thanks to the development of frontal lobe, humans also possess a “slow” thinking system. This “slow” system is responsible for complex step-by-step reasoning. It lets us plan future events, engage in arguments, or follow mathematical proofs.
Because using the “slow” system is so mentally draining, we tend to default to the “fast” one — even when dealing with intellectual tasks like coding.
Imagine that you’re in the middle of a lot of work, and you want to quickly identify what this function does.

独特的是，由于脑前叶的发展，人类也拥有“缓慢的”思维系统。这种“缓慢”的系统负责复杂的逐步推理。它使我们能够计划未来的事件，进行争论或遵循数学证明。
因为使用“慢速”系统非常费力，所以即使在处理诸如编码之类的智力任务时，我们也倾向于默认为“快速”系统。
想象一下，您正处于大量工作之中，并且想要快速确定此功能的作用。 

Take a quick look at it:
```js
function duplicateSpreadsheet(original) {
  if (original.hasPendingChanges) {
    throw new Error('You need to save the file before you can duplicate it.');
  }
  let copy = {
    created: Date.now(),
    author: original.author,
    cells: original.cells,
    metadata: original.metadata,
  };
  copy.metadata.title = 'Copy of ' + original.metadata.title;
  return copy;
}
```
You’ve probably noticed that:
This function duplicates a spreadsheet.
It throws an error if the original spreadsheet isn’t saved.
It prepends “Copy of” to the new spreadsheet’s title.
What you might not have noticed (great job if you did though!) is that this function also accidentally changes the title of the original spreadsheet.
Missing bugs like this is something that happens to every programmer, every day. But now that you know a bug exists, will you read the code differently? If you’ve been reading code in the “fast” mode, it’s likely you’ll switch to the more laborious “slow” mode to find it.
In the “fast” mode, we guess what the code does based on naming, comments, and its overall structure. In the “slow” mode, we retrace what the code does step by step.
That’s why having a correct mental model is so important. Simulating a computer in our heads is hard enough — and this effort is wasted with wrong mental models.
Don’t worry if you can’t find the bug at all. This means you’ll get the most out of this course! Over the next modules, we’ll rebuild our mental model of JavaScript together so that you see this bug plain as day.
In the next module, we'll start building mental models for some of the most fundamental JavaScript concepts — values and variables.
